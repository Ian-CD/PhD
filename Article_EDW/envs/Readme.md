## Environment

To run the notebooks used to produce the figures for the paper, the correct environment is needed (i.e. the python packages and libraries that I used, with their correct versions).

The file environment_phd_v3.yml can be used to replicate the environment that I used.
Please follow the instructions at this link on how to create an environment from a .yml file :
