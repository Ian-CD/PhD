Title : Alpine climate over the 20th and the 21st centuries: from large scale simulations to regional and local imprints

I will be using data from the MAR (Modèle Atmosphérique Régional) model to investigate climate change in the Alps. This PhD is part of the CLIMAIR project which aims to better understand the local imprints of climate change on air pollution, health, and societal issues in the Grenoble metropolitan area.
